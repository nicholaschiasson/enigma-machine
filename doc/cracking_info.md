## Flaws

With the exception of models A and B, the last rotor came before a 'reflector'. 
The reflector connected outputs of the last rotor in pairs, redirecting current back 
through the rotors by a different route. The reflector ensured that Enigma is self-reciprocal: 
conveniently, encryption was the same as decryption. However, __the reflector also gave Enigma 
the property that no letter ever encrypted to itself__. This was a severe conceptual flaw 
and a cryptological mistake subsequently exploited by codebreakers.
